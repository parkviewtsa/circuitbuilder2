crItem* DrawItem = crCreateItem("resistor.cbip");
// Now you have a draw object.
// It will be drawn in future calls to crDraw() along with all other draw objects.
DrawItem->posx = 0;
DrawItem->posy = 0;
// Now it is centered at the origin. (There is no default position.)
crDraw();
// You have just rendered to the internal window.
// In the future this function may return a pixel buffer or something.
crDestroyItem(DrawItem);
// This draw object has been removed and its memory has been deallocated.
// It will not be drawn in subsequent calls to crDraw().
// Attempting to set its memory after destruction will crash the application.



Draw objects have no properties aside from their positions in the world,
and the prototype (line group) for drawing.



- Example of Usage -
struct cbResistor
{
	crItem* drawitem;
